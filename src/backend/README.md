## Server script to show the generated shakespear content to the user

### uses C so as to make the script maintainable and fast, this is directly inspired from my server script found at [here](https://github.com/AyushChakraborty/C_http_server), additionally it will handle a few more things like entering prompt and showing the generated text

### do make sure to start the server first, the server executable is present as name "server", so run the following in your terminal first
### ```./server ```

### once its running, go to ```localhost:8080/main.html``` to start the action :)
